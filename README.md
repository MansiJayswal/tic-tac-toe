# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic Tac Toe Web Application is a fun and interactive game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

# Description 
The application features a user-friendly interface with a visually appealing design, implemented using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. The game board is displayed on the web page, with each cell representing a square where players can place their symbols (X or O).

The game offers a smooth user experience, incorporating various interactive elements. When it's a player's turn, they can simply click on an empty cell to place their symbol. The application intelligently handles invalid moves, preventing players from overwriting each other's moves or selecting occupied cells.

To enhance the user experience, the application provides feedback and visual cues. It dynamically updates the display, highlighting the winning line and declaring the winner once a player achieves a winning combination. Additionally, it detects a tie when all cells are filled without any winning lines.

The Tic Tac Toe Web Application allows users to play multiple rounds, providing the option to reset the game board and start a fresh match. This feature ensures continuous entertainment for players and encourages competitive gameplay.

Furthermore, the application is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, making it accessible and enjoyable across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
